Multiple tests indicated an error with the constructor in Appt.java. The appointments were being set with an invalid month, causing an IndexOutOfBounds exception. The error is on line 93, where startMonth is set equal to the provided value for startDay instead.

The second bug I found was in the TimeTable class. It showed another out of bounds error, with the test indicating an index of -1 in the getApptRange function. On line 53, the loop decrements i instead of incrementing it, sending i into negative numbers.
